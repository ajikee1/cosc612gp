This is a group project where the goal is to build a functioning e-commerce site.  This site will not be in use by a business.
The front end of this project is going to be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  For the backend, we plan on using PHP and a 
SQL database.  Users will be able to search products, add products to their cart, and checkout like any existing e-commerce site.
We will also integrate a PayPal option for users that want to pay through that instead of adding their credit card information.
Users will need to make a login acccount in order to place an order in this site.
